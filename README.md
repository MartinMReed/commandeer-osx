Commandeer is designed to be a Mobile-to-Desktop camera streaming application. It is essentially still in a prototype state and only supports BlackBerry 10 to OSX (and vice versa).

Commandeer consists of three projects:  
[commandeer-bb10](https://github.com/MartinMReed/commandeer-bb10)  
[commandeer-osx](https://github.com/MartinMReed/commandeer-osx)  
[commandeer-server](https://github.com/MartinMReed/commandeer-server)  

The FFmpeg related functionality is provided through [libffbb](https://github.com/hardisonbrewing/libffbb). See libffbb for instructions on building FFmpeg.
